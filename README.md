# Islamic Units
Bridging Classical and Modern Measurements in Islamic Jurisprudence

Many students studying Islamic Jurisprudence (Fiqh) often struggle to understand traditional measurements and their modern equivalents. This app aims to address this challenge by offering a straightforward converter for a wide range of units, including classical ones like the Saaâ€™ and the Mudd, and converting them into contemporary SI units such as kilograms and liters.

In addition, the app facilitates conversions for essential Fiqh-related quantities, such as travel distances, the nisab of zakat, and more.

To cater to varying interpretations, the app supports the selection of one of the four main Sunni schools of Fiqh: Hanbali, Shafi'i, Hanafi, and Maliki. It provides unit values based on the specific methodology of the chosen school.

May Allah bless this app and make it a source of benefit for the Ummah ðŸ¤²

Note: I have primarily studied the Hanbali School of jurisprudence and may not be equally versed in the finer details of other schools. If you find any discrepancies or errors in the unit conversions for a specific school, please don't hesitate to contact me. Jazakum Allahu Khairan!
